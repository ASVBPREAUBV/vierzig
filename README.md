## Installation

Create a new Hugo Site and inside the site folder run the following commands:

    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/ASVBPREAUBV/vierzig

To learn how to create a Hugo Site read the [official guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### Netlify

If you are using Netlify to host your hugo site, you will want to add it as a submodule instead of cloning:

    $ cd themes
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/ASVBPREAUBV/vierzig

This is because Netlify uses the hugo build command when autopublish is enabled and will produce an error if the theme is not a submodule.
See the [Hugo Guide](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/#use-hugo-themes-with-netlify) for more information.

If your javascript or css isn't rendering, check your BaseURL in the `config.toml` file.
i.e. if you are publishing to https://www.yourdomain.com your BaseURL should be `BaseURL = https://www.yourdomain.com`

## Using the theme

After cloning Forty or adding it as a submodule, there are a few other things you should do:

### Config File

There is an [`exampleSite`](//github.com/MarcusVirg/forty/tree/master/exampleSite) folder for this theme.
Copy the file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/MarcusVirg/forty/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) to your websites root directory.
Here you can customize some of the text and content on the website.

### Create new project

To create a new blog post, you can take advantage of archetypes and use the Hugo command:

    $ cd hugoProjectDirectory
    $ hugo new projects/newProject.md

Replace `newProject.md` with your own file name. 

### Preview

You can see a preview of your site while developing it by running Hugo's built-in webserver.

    $ hugo server -D

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313/) in the address bar of your browser to see your site.

`NOTE: In the command above -D loads content that is marked as a draft. You can switch content from draft to final by changing the frontmatter value of draft to false in the .md file for the content.`
